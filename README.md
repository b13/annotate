# Annotate - A TYPO3 Extension

_Add comments and discussions and work in collaboration in TYPO3 Backend anywhere._

## What does it do?

If you've ever used Google Docs, you might like the possibility to leave a comment, note or an assignment to others.
This extension aims to provide a similar functionality for TYPO3 editors in a single installation.

## Installation

`composer req b13/annotate`

There is no permission system, as everybody can create comments.

## Future Ideas

- Show assigned todos in the toolbar
- Notify assigned users via email

## License

As TYPO3 Core, this extension is licensed under the GPLv2 or later.

## Authors

b13 GmbH.
